# Satoshi Kon Tribute Page
The first project I've created while seriously learning Front End Development.
I'd used html, css, and bootstrap to create this webpage. This page was created
as project for an online course call Free Code Camp.

Html5
For the most part, most of this page was made using basic html code. I decided
to add some Html5 semantics for good practice.

Css
Just basic css coding, nothing too special about the coding.

Bootstrap
The majority of the responsiveness was created with bootstrap. Everything is
responsive down to mobile size.
