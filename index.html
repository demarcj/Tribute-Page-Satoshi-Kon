                            <h3>Early career</h3>
                            <p class="para">While in college, Kon made his debut as a manga artist with the short manga Toriko (1984) and earned a runner-up spot in the 10th Annual Tetsuya Chiba Awards held by Young Magazine (Kodansha). Afterward, he found work as Katsuhiro
                                Otomo's assistant. After graduating from college in 1987, Kon authored the one-volume manga Kaikisen (1990) and wrote the script for Katsuhiro Otomo's live-action film World Apartment Horror.In 1995, Kon served as the scriptwriter,
                                layout artist and art director of the short film Magnetic Rose, the first of three short films in Katsuhiro Otomo's omnibus Memories. Kon's work afterward would be distinguished by the recurring theme of the blending of
                                fantasy and reality.</p>
                            <h3>Directing</h3>
                            <p class="para">In 1993, Kon scripted and co-produced the fifth episode of the original video animation JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In 1997, Kon began work on his directorial debut Perfect Blue (based on Yoshikazu Takeuchi's novel of the same
                                name). A suspense story centered on a pop idol, it was the first film by Kon to be produced by Madhouse. Kon was initially unsatisfied with the original screenplay written by the author and requested to make changes to
                                it. Aside from maintaining three elements of the novel ("idol", "horror" and "stalker"), Kon was allowed to make any changes he desired. The screenplay was written by Sadayuki Murai, who worked in the idea of a blurred
                                border between the real world and imagination.In 2004, Kon released the 13-episode television series Paranoia Agent, in which Kon revisits the theme of the blending of imagination and reality, as well as working in additional
                                social themes. Kon also helped establish and served as a member of the Japan Animation Creators Association (JAniCA)</p>
                            <h3>Health Deterioration and Death</h3>
                            <p class="para">Following Ohay≈ç, Kon began work on his next film, Dreaming Machine. In May 2010, Kon was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend the remainder of his life in his home. Shortly
                                before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained in the message, he chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out
                                of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged his body had become.</p>
